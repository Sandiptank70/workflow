# ✅ SYNTAX ERROR FIXED!

The file was accidentally truncated. I've added the missing closing tags.

## 🚀 Restart Frontend Now:

```bash
cd /mnt/user-data/outputs/workflow-automation-platform
docker-compose restart frontend
```

Wait ~30 seconds, then:
- Open http://localhost:3000
- Press **Ctrl+Shift+R** (hard refresh)

---

## ✅ Now You'll See:

### Integration Types:
- **Edit button** (✏️) on each card
- **Delete button** (🗑️) on each card
- Click edit → modal with all data including tasks
- Click delete → confirmation → deleted

### Workflows - Add Node:
- Select integration
- **Task dropdown appears!** (not text input)
- Shows "Send Notification" not "send_notification"
- Task description below dropdown
- Parameters auto-fill

---

**Just restart and it will work!** 🚀

```bash
./restart-frontend.sh
```

Or:
```bash
docker-compose restart frontend
```
