## 🔍 Understanding the Data

### Node Results Explained

Each node execution contains:

**node_id**: Unique identifier for the node
```json
"node_id": "node-1697123456789"
```

**task**: The task that was executed
```json
"task": "send_notification"
```

**integration_id**: Which integration was used
```json
"integration_id": 1
```

**success**: Whether the task succeeded
```json
"success": true
```

**message**: Human-readable result message
```json
"message": "Notification sent successfully!"
```

**data**: Actual response data from the integration
```json
"data": {
  "title": "Deployment Complete",
  "status": "success"
}
```

**execution_time_seconds**: Time taken for this node
```json
"execution_time_seconds": 1.234
```

**timestamp**: When this node executed
```json
"timestamp": "2025-10-15T10:30:01"
```

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### Tip 1: Use Refresh Button
Click the "Refresh" button to see latest executions without reloading the page.

### Tip 2: Check Response Data
Click "View Response Data" under each node to see the actual API response from integrations.

### Tip 3: Filter by Status
Look for green badges (success) or red badges (failed) to quickly identify issues.

### Tip 4: Compare Execution Times
Check the duration column to see if workflows are running slower than expected.

### Tip 5: Track Trigger Sources
Use the trigger source to understand what initiated each execution (manual, api, webhook, cron, etc.)

---

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Programmatic Access

**Python Example:**
```python
import requests

# Get all executions
response = requests.get('http://localhost:8000/api/workflows/executions/all')
executions = response.json()

# Find failed executions
failed = [e for e in executions if e['status'] == 'failed']

for execution in failed:
    print(f"Execution {execution['id']} failed:")
    print(f"  Error: {execution['error_message']}")
    print(f"  Workflow: {execution['workflow_id']}")
```

**JavaScript Example:**
```javascript
// Get executions for workflow
async function getExecutionHistory(workflowId) {
  const response = await fetch(
    `http://localhost:8000/api/workflows/${workflowId}/executions`
  );
  const executions = await response.json();
  
  // Calculate success rate
  const total = executions.length;
  const successful = executions.filter(e => e.status === 'success').length;
  const successRate = (successful / total * 100).toFixed(2);
  
  console.log(`Success rate: ${successRate}%`);
  return executions;
}
```

## 📊 Statistics & Metrics

### Available Metrics

From execution history, you can calculate:

1. **Success Rate**
   ```
   (successful_executions / total_executions) × 100
   ```

2. **Average Execution Time**
   ```
   sum(execution_times) / total_executions
   ```

3. **Failure Rate**
   ```
   (failed_executions / total_executions) × 100
   ```

4. **Most Common Errors**
   - Group by error_message
   - Count occurrences

5. **Peak Usage Times**
   - Group by hour/day
   - Count executions
