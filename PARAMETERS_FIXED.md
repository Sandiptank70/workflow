# ✅ Parameters Field - FIXED!

## 🔧 What Was Changed

The Parameters (JSON) field in the workflow builder has been improved to be more user-friendly.

---

## ✨ New Features

### 1. **Optional Field**
- You can now leave it as `{}` if no parameters are needed
- Won't break if you don't type anything

### 2. **Better Error Handling**
- If JSON is invalid, shows alert but still adds node
- Uses empty object `{}` as fallback
- No more silent failures

### 3. **Helpful UI**
- Shows hint: "Optional, leave {} for no params"
- Displays tip below field
- Better placeholder text

### 4. **Improved Validation**
- Validates on submit, not on every keystroke
- Won't block you from typing
- More forgiving

## 🎯 How to Use Now

### For Tasks Without Parameters (like test_connection)

**Just leave it as:**
```json
{}
```

That's it! Click "Add Node" and you're done.

---

### For Tasks With Parameters

**Type your JSON:**
```json
{
  "text": "Hello Teams!",
  "status": "success"
}
```

If you make a typo, it will:
1. Show an alert
2. Still add the node
3. Use `{}` as parameters
4. Let you edit later

## 📋 Common Parameter Patterns

### Empty (No Parameters)
```json
{}
```
**Use for:** test_connection, list operations

---

### Single Field
```json
{
  "text": "Your message"
}
```
**Use for:** send_simple_message

---

### Multiple Fields
```json
{
  "title": "Title",
  "message": "Message",
  "status": "success"
}
```
**Use for:** send_notification, send_card_message

---

### Complex Nested
```json
{
  "title": "Report",
  "sections": [
    {
      "facts": [
        {"name": "CPU", "value": "45%"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
**Use for:** send_rich_card
